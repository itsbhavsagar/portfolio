  description: "üî• React Frontend Developer | Architecting Interfaces That Move & Speak",

  summary: "By day, I craft **rich, interactive UIs** as a **React Developer**, building next-gen learning experiences at a fast-moving product company. **My toolkit?** A precise blend of **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and just enough animation magic to make things *feel right*. But that‚Äôs just the surface. Behind the scenes, I‚Äôm quietly exploring the crossroads of **design, motion, and intelligence**‚Äîexperimenting with **AI agents**, deep UI systems, and building tools that don't just work, but *respond*. I occasionally share what I learn‚Äîwhen it‚Äôs ready. Until then, let‚Äôs just say I‚Äôm building something worth *clicking twice*.",
