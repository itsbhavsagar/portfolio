# Understanding Redux: A Beginner’s Guide

Redux is a powerful state management library for JavaScript applications—especially popular in the React ecosystem. It provides a predictable way to manage state changes in your application, making your code easier to maintain and debug.

## What is Redux?

Redux is a **state container** that helps you write applications that behave consistently across different environments. It enforces a unidirectional data flow and makes state changes explicit, which improves maintainability and debuggability.

## Core Concepts of Redux

Redux revolves around a few key concepts:

1. **Store:**
   The single source of truth that holds your application's entire state.

2. **Actions:**
   Plain JavaScript objects that describe an event or change. Every action must have a `type` property.

3. **Reducers:**
   Pure functions that take the previous state and an action, and return the next state.

4. **Dispatch:**
   A function that sends actions to the store to trigger a state change.

## How Does Redux Work?

When an action is dispatched, Redux passes it along with the current state to a reducer. The reducer then calculates the new state based on the action type. This new state replaces the old one in the store, prompting the UI to re-render.

Here's an example of a simple reducer:

```js
// counterReducer.js
const initialState = { count: 0 };

function counterReducer(state = initialState, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'INCREMENT':
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case 'DECREMENT':
      return { count: state.count - 1 };
    default:
      return state;
  }
}

export default counterReducer;
```
